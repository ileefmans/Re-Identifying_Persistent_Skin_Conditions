SCINet identifies facial skin conditions which are persistent over time. Given two facial images of the same patient at different stages in their treatment, with conditions already detected, we can automate the process of identifying which conditions persist. 
  
  The link to below leads to a quick demo providing a high-level intuition about what this module does.

SCINet leverages opencv's pretrained facial detection model to align the faces and then match corresponding skin conditions
